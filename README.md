# HelpGUI
## What is HelpGUI?
HelpGUI is a simple, yet powerfull Help-request-plugin.  
To send a help-request, the player just need to type /help and click on the playerhead of the player, that he wants help.

## Feautures
* **Easy to use**  
You don't need to set permission, to let players use the plugin!  
Just put it in your plugins-folder, restart the server and you're done.
* **Configure almost everything!**  
HelpGUI let you edit almost every message in the plugin.  
Want your own language for the command-help? Just change it!
* **Many feautures**  
HelpGUI comes with a bunch of different feautures.  
Let the GUI only show certain players, by configuring it.
* **Player and Group-Search**  
Players can search for players, by just adding text after the command (/help [Text]).  
HelpGUI will then search for every player, that has a name, beginning with the text.  
But you can also search for groups (You need Vault for that). Just type /help group:[group] and HelpGUI will search for every player, that has this group!

## Want a feauture?
Go to the [Issue-tab](https://github.com/Andre601/HelpGUI/issues) and ask there for a new feauture.  
If it is possible, then I will add it to the plugin.
