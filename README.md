# HelpGUI
[![licenseImg]][license] [![issuesImg]][issues]

## What is HelpGUI?
HelpGUI is a simple, yet powerfull Help-request-plugin.  
To send a help-request, the player just need to type /help and click on the playerhead of the player, that he wants help.

## Feautures
##### Simple to use
HelpGUI is stupidly simple.  
You can just drag and drop the jar into your server, restart and it is ready to go.

##### Highly configurable
You can customize the plugin to your liking.  
Only show certain players, hide certain players, use the commands in certain worlds only, etc.  
The well documented config will help you changing stuff to your liking.

##### Support almost everywhere
You can ask for support on all kinds of places.  
Discord, Spigot(-PM), GitHub-issue, etc.  
The Dev (So me :P) will always try to help you with your problem.

## Want a feauture?
Go to the [Issue-tab](https://github.com/Andre601/HelpGUI/issues) and ask there for a new feauture.  
If it is possible, then I will add it to the plugin.
